# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

My attempt was for the AI to choose its piece based on the best score
I got lost in my attempt and broke the code it makes the intial piece
but not any subsequent or it only makes line pieces if i hard code it

No compile or runtime errors that I saw so thats a plus and means i can 
continue to develop it
